# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Applied

## Error Fixed

The `node:fs` error has been resolved by:

1. **Updated `next.config.ts`** - Added proper webpack fallbacks for Node.js modules
2. **Updated `src/app/page.tsx`** - Made PptxGenJS load dynamically only on client-side

## How to Run Now

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Or on Windows:
# rmdir /s .next

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

## What Was Changed

### 1. next.config.ts
Added fallbacks for Node.js core modules that shouldn't be used in browser:
- `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:os`
- `fs`, `path`, `os`, `crypto`, `stream`, `buffer`

### 2. page.tsx
- Dynamically imports PptxGenJS only on client-side
- Uses `useEffect` to load the library after component mounts
- Checks if library is loaded before allowing PPT download

## Test It

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 and try:

```
Create 5 slides about artificial intelligence
```

Click "Download PPT" when ready!

## If Still Having Issues

Try completely clearing everything:

```bash
# Stop server
# Delete these folders:
rm -rf .next node_modules

# Reinstall
npm install

# Run again
npm run dev
```
